# Semantic-Segmentation-with-Sparse-Labels
The labels and codes for [Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images with Sparse Annotations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03492.pdf).

## Data
We provided three types of sparse annotations: point, scribble, and polygon.

## Usage
1) Install dependencies in ```requirements.txt```
2) Download [data]() and [weights]() to respective folders and unzip them
3) run ```python train.py``` and ```python test.py``` for testing and training
